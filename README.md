# Fault-Tolerant Scratchpad Memory (Temporary Working Repository)

This is a repository for refactoring the fault-tolerant-spm project. Previous versions of the project were not modular enough, so this serves as a revision of the project into a more modular form.

Currently being worked on by Albert. Do not touch!

Files will later be transferred to a standard git repository. This is a working repository for microcommits.

Makefile build uses g++ 4.9.0 or greater for regex support. Perhaps future implementations will be less dependent on regex.
